# Usage examples

The links below reference IPython notebooks where you can see how to apply EmpiricalRiskMinimization.jl
for various (increasingly complex) use cases.

## Examples of models on simple data
These examples link to notebooks that demonstrate how to use ERM.jl for various common machine learning models.
They use randomly generated data; the focus is on optional and extended features that ERM makes available to users.

- [Linear regression]()
- [Robust regression]()
- [Logistic regression]()
- [Support vector machine]()

## Examples of models on real datasets
These examples link to notebooks demonstrating ho wto use ERM.jl on real data. Many of these examples come from the
[EE104](http://ee104.stanford.edu) lectures.

- [Housing prices]()
- [Diabetes progression]()
